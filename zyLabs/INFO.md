# zyLabs
zyLabs are labs that are taken from the zyBook that was used as the interactive textbook for the course.. Similar to the base repository, zyLabs that are only 1 C++ source file will be stored in the Individual-Programs folder, while multi-file programs will be stored in their own folders. Each Lab is numbered as well to see the order they were done in.
