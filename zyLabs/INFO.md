# zyLabs
zyLabs are labs that are taken from the zyBook that was used as the interactive textbook for the course.. Similar to the base repository, zyLabs that are only 1 C++ source file will be stored in the Individual-Programs folder, while programs with multiple source code files or input files will be stored in their own folders. Each Lab is numbered as well to see the order they were done in.
